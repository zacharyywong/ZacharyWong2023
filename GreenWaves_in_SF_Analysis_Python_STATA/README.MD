**24 Hour Challenge**

In Spring 2011, the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency implemented GreenWaves in the SF Mission district to encourage residents to bicycle instead of drive. The GreenWaves are synchronized traffic lights that let bicyclists encounter a series of green lights, so they experience fewer stops in the particular block. 

While there is community support for this initiative and the SF government has used these GreenWaves as evidence for their city’s success in becoming more environmentally conscious, I evaluate whether these GreenWaves indeed increased the number of bicyclists in SF or whether their claims are only based on intuition. 

If these claims are true, SF and other Bay Area policymakers should invest in implementing more GreenWaves - the increase in bicyclists may decrease traffic congestion in the SF area, increase workers’ productivity, and help make Silicon Valley a greener, healthier space for all its residents.
