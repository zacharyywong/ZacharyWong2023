My 3 portfolio projects are listed below. The first is my thesis paper completed for my culminating experience as an Economics major at Dartmouth. The last 2 projects were completed in my spare time: these each required me to apply programming concepts, data analytical skills, and econometrics to analyze more ambiguous problems with looser specifications.

**Econ Thesis Paper (10 Weeks - 6/2023): STATA**
- This paper investigates whether higher multinational hotel concentrations negatively impact the sales of independent, domestic hotels within a country. I use Ordinary Least Squares with country/year fixed effects as my identification strategy. Overall, this study finds that foreign hotel concentration causes a decrease in domestic hotel sales, both when defining a particular hotel market as a whole country and after restricting the hotel market to the country’s capital city. Furthermore, I do not find significant evidence that a primary driver of these results is due to domestic hotels’ lack of easy access to communication-related technologies. 

**GreenWaves in SF Analysis (24 Hour Challenge - 3/2022): Python/STATA**
- Performed/visualized causal analysis using 3 public time series datasets to identify high-return investments that
effectively increased the number of bicyclists in San Francisco

**Shazam ETL Pipeline (72 Hour Challenge - 1/2022): Python**
- Built/automated an end-to-end ETL pipeline to increase revenue/optimize resources for recording labels by surfacing
important songs/artists from Shazam
