A portfolio of data projects I have completed (I completed the first 2 projects listed outside of class in my spare time and completed the third project in my CS10 class as a graded lab).

Shazam ETL Pipeline (Python): Built/automated an end-to-end ETL pipeline to increase revenue/optimize resources for recording labels by surfacing important songs/artists

Statistical/Causal Analysis (Python/SQL/STATA): Performed/visualized causal analysis using 3 public time series datasets to identify high-return investments that effectively increased the number of bicyclists in San Francisco

Pattern Recognition (Java): Build a model from a database of sentences to predict the best Parts of Speech (POS) for words in a sentence. Supports both console and file driven usage.
