A personal portfolio of code-related projects I have completed either in class or in my spare time.

Atlantic Records: Used Shazam API and Pandas/Numpy libraries in Python to surface important songs on Shazam's Top20 Charts. The Deliverable: A CSV file with the Top 5 Most Important Songs

Pattern Recognition (Java): Built a model based on training data that tags parts of speech of every word in new sentences. The Deliverable: A Java Program supporting both user and text file input
