Here are 3 projects included in my portfolio. 

**Y_Combinator WebScrape**: Built a multi-threading asynchronous webscraping program to retrieve and organize data on hundreds of Y-Combinator company and founders into an Excel sheet in minutes

**Shazam_ETL_Pipeline_Python**: Given 48-72 hours, built/automated an end-to-end ETL pipeline to increase revenue/optimize resources for recording labels by surfacing important songs/artists

**GreenWaves_in_SF_Analysis_Python_STATA**: Give 24 hours, performed/visualized causal analysis using 3 public time series datasets to identify high-return investments that effectively increased the number of bicyclists in San Francisco

The first project required me to write code that avoids race conditions when retrieving companies from a shared list and writing their data to shared Pandas DataFrames.

The latter two projects required me to apply programming abilities with data analytics and econometrics concepts to analyze more ambiguous problems with looser specifications. I completed these 2 projects outside of class in my spare time.
