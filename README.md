Here are 3 projects included in my portfolio. 

**Pattern_Recognition_CS10_Java**: Built a model from a database of sentences to predict the best Parts of Speech (POS) for words in a sentence. Supports both console and file inputs. 

**Shazam_ETL_Pipeline_Python**: Given 48-72 hours, built/automated an end-to-end ETL pipeline to increase revenue/optimize resources for recording labels by surfacing important songs/artists

**GreenWaves_in_SF_Analysis_Python_STATA**: Give 24 hours, performed/visualized causal analysis using 3 public time series datasets to identify high-return investments that effectively increased the number of bicyclists in San Francisco

The first project listed is a pure programming assignment that required me to use data structures including HashMaps and ArrayLists. I completed this project in my CS10 course as a graded lab and with limited assistance.

The latter two projects required me to apply programming abilities with data analytics and econometrics concepts to analyze more ambiguous problems with looser specifications. I completed these 2 projects outside of class in my spare time.
