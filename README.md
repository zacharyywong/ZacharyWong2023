Here are 3 projects included in my portfolio. Pattern Recognition is a pure programming assignment that required me to use data structures such as HashMaps and ArrayLists. The latter two projects required me to apply technical programming skills to analyze and solve real-world problems using data analytics and Econometrics concepts. I completed the first project listed in my CS10 class as a graded lab and completed the other 2 projects outside of class in my spare time. 

Pattern_Recognition_CS10 (Java): Built a model from a database of sentences to predict the best Parts of Speech (POS) for words in a sentence. Supports both console and file inputs. 

Shazam ETL Pipeline (Python): Built/automated an end-to-end ETL pipeline to increase revenue/optimize resources for recording labels by surfacing important songs/artists

GreenWaves_in_SF_Analysis (Python/SQL/STATA): Performed/visualized causal analysis using 3 public time series datasets to identify high-return investments that effectively increased the number of bicyclists in San Francisco
