# Burn Fail Descriptions
burnCACDesc = "Since your CAC Payback Period is also high, " \

burnNRRDesc = "Since your Net Retention Rate is low, the problem most likely lies in the company's low ARR growth, specifically due to a high rate of churn. A leaky bucket makes it hard to grow efficiently."
burnGrowthDesc = "Your low growth rate may be indicative that you need to go back to the drawing board to ensure that your product or service is what the market truly needs."
burnRule40Desc = "Since your gross margins are low, the problem most likely lies in the company's high net burn, specifically due to high spending COGS. If thereâ€™s not operating leverage in the business, the Burn Multiple will not improve with scale."


# CAC Fail descriptions
CACBurnDesc = 'Since your burn multiple is high, the problem is most likely due to high spending on sales and marketing to acquire customers, specifically a high customer acquisition costs'
CACNRRDesc = 'Since your net retention rates are low, the problem may lie in low average MRR per customer, to specifically due to high churn and contractions before you have recovered their acquisition costs '
CACGrowthDesc = "Since your growth rates are lower than ideal, the problem is most likely due to low returns, specifically a low average MRR per customer"
CACRule40Desc = 'Since you have not passed the Rule of 40, the problem is most likely due to low gross margins, specifically because of high COGS spending.'


# NRR Fail Descriptions
NRRBurnDesc = 'Since your burn multiple is high, the problem most likely lies in low net new MRR, specifically due to low rates of expansions and upsells'
NRRCACDesc = 'Since your CAC Payback Ratio is high, the problem most likely lies in high churn and contractions, specifically due to a high, restrictive Customer Acquisition Cost'
NRRGrowthDesc = 'Since your growth rates are lower than ideal, the problem lies in low returns, specifically due to the combination of low expansion and upsells and high churn and contractions'
NRRRule40Desc = "While the Rule of 40 can't sufficiently pinpoint why your NRR is low, failing the Rule of 40 may be indicative that you are not growing fast enough. Check your growth rates."


# Growth Fail Descriptions
growthBurnDesc = "The low burn multiple is only further evidence that your growth rates are lower than ideal, It may also indicate that you aren't spending your cash as efficienctly as possible to achieve your low growth rates"
growthCACDesc = "Your high CAC Payback ratio further substantiates the fact that you're acquiring a low number of customers and/or generating low average returns per acquired customer"
growthNRRDesc = 'The low NRR is indicative of a combination of high churn rates and/or low expansions and upsells of your products.'
growthRule40Desc = "Your failure of the Rule of 40 means that your gross margins aren't high enough to compensate for low growth. Please check the Profitability aspects of the report to see what are some potential ways to increase your gross margins."

                    'of your product to ensure that your burn or churn rates are not negating each sale that you make. \n'

rule40SuccessDesc = "This means that you are either at least somewhat profitable or growing at an extremely high pace to compensate for low or negative gross margins.\n" \
                    "However, if you're at early stages, check the growth rate of your company. If you're near a 20 / 20 split, you have passed the Rule of 40 but still be stuck in sub-scale growth mode.\n" \
